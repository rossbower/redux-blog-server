#HW 5 - Ross Bower

For this homework, I created the API to store store posts and users for the blog. I now display authors with their corresponding posts. I decided to allow unauthorized users to see the main page, but not see the individual post OR create new post page.

Everything works :)

Extra Credit:
  - Additional styling of the page. Looks deliverable.
